Familiarity with Different Directories and Tools
•	Directory Exploration:
o	Familiarize with various directories and their contents. Explore each folder to understand the information they contain.
Openlane: Automating RTL to GDS Flow
1.	Interactive Session:
o	Open an interactive session with Openlane.
o	Input all necessary packages to interact with Openlane effectively.
2.	Design Selection:
o	Openlane contains multiple design folders. For this assignment, we will work with the picorv32a design.
3.	File System Preparation:
o	Prepare the file system before running synthesis in Openlane.
o	Set up the design environment to ensure all necessary files are in the desired locations.
o	Merge the technology LEF (tech LEF) and the cell-level LEF (cell LEF).
4.	Preparation Stage Completion:
o	Once the preparation is complete, a runs directory is created within the picorv32a design directory. This directory is named with the current date to reflect when the LEF files were merged.
